# Data Upload

CarbonFoorprint API is used to get the emission values of various gases. This API has a functionality of providing carbon emission data, either by calculating in the real-time or from the existing data. The main aim of this page is to provide an option to any user for suggesting data which they have collected or think that might help our API.

This web page has two options 
1. Structure data
2. Unstructured Data

Structured data is the page where there are various forms which have a similar structure to that of our existing data. Users suggesting data through this page will need to have data matching our schema. This will be useful for us to approve and directly append to our existing database.

In the unstructured data page, users will be provided with an option of uploading a file of carbon footprint (not necessarily having a similar as of ours).
