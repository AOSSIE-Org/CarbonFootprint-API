It can        also  deliver components of emission like generation and        transmission  & dissipation when queried with item names        generation and td     respectively.The data source for this is   here. The region that   is unavailable results in returning     the emission for the Default  region which is calculated as a   average of the whole data.\n\n2. Airplane Fuel\n  - Airplane fuel converts the distance flown by a particular air    plane to corresponing CO2 emission.\n\n3. Vehicle Fuel\n  - Emission route can be requested with fuel quantity and type     and   unit , to return the GHG emission generated on the        consumption   of the same.The fuels that we currently support   are listed in Source/Core/core/resources/fuels.json\n  \n4. Trains\n  - Emission route can provide you with the emission generated      from a train journey, provided with the distance of the         journey.Here the item is the the train type and multiply        signifies the number of passengers.\n  \n5. Trees\n  - Emission route can be requested with tree name and the number   of years to find out the CO2 absorption from it per year.The    trees that we currently support are listed                      /Source/Core/core/resources/trees.json.\n  \n6. Appliances\n  - Emission route can be requested with a appliance name and the   number of units and no of hours to find out the CO2 emission    for the running time.The appliances that we currently support   are listed /raw_data/appliances.json.\n\nUSE ONLY ONE EXAMPLE GIVEN IN THE BODY AT A TIME.\n\nYou need to sepcify your 'access-key' (which you got from https://carbonhub.org/) variable in the header."
